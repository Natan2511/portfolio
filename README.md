# Portfolio

Hi, my name is Nathaniel and I'm a frontend developer with experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, SCSS and GIT. I am constantly striving to improve my skills in user interface development.

I am a young and energetic person ready to contribute to the team and fully dedicated to projects. In addition to work, I am actively involved in sports, which helps me find a balance between work and my personal life.

I'm looking to apply my skills and knowledge as a front-end developer and work in a team of professionals who share my passion for this field. I would be happy to discuss the possibility of joining your company.

Thank you and see you soon!
